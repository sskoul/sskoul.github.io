I am an Assistant Professor in the Department of Computer Science at [Aarhus University](https://international.au.dk/), and a member of the [Computational Complexity and Game Theory](https://cs.au.dk/research/computational-complexity-and-game-theory/) group. Before that, I was a postdoctoral researcher at [École Polytechnique Fédérale de Lausanne](https://www.epfl.ch/en/) and [Singapore University of Technology and Design](https://www.sutd.edu.sg/). I received my PhD from [National Technical University of Athens](https://ntua.gr/en/) in algorithmic game theory and theoretical computer science. 

Research
======

My research lies at the intersection of game theory, machine learning, and optimization. I am particularly interested in understanding the collective behavior of learning algorithms in critical settings, including markets, blockchain systems, and the training of AI agents. More recently, my work has also focused on developing efficient optimization methods for training machine learning models, as well as applying deep learning techniques to combinatorial optimization problems.
