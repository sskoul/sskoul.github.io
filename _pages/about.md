I am an Assistant Professor in the Department of Computer Science at [Aarhus University](https://international.au.dk/), and a member of the [Computational Complexity and Game Theory](https://cs.au.dk/research/computational-complexity-and-game-theory/) group. Before that, I was a postdoctoral researcher at [École Polytechnique Fédérale de Lausanne](https://www.epfl.ch/en/) and [Singapore University of Technology and Design](https://www.sutd.edu.sg/). I received my PhD from [National Technical University of Athens](https://ntua.gr/en/) in algorithmic game theory and theoretical computer science. 

Research
======

My research focuses on the mathematical foundations of Game Theory, Machine Learning, and Optimization. I am particularly interested in understanding the collective behavior of machine learning algorithms in fundamental economic settings, such as auctions, markets, and traffic systems.
